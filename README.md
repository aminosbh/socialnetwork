# Social Network Java Project

The `Social Network Java Project` is a training project that aims to help
students improve their Java programming skills and learn new programming
concepts and techniques.

This tutorial is divided into chapters. Each one of them will implement a part
of the project and let you learn a unique programming technique.

This tutorial is managed with [git][] which means that you can go through the
different commits to lean about the different steps and development decisions.
Each commit is self-documented.


**Chapter 0:** Create a Maven project

This project uses [Maven][] as a build system and [Eclipse][Eclipse IDE] as
a main IDE.
